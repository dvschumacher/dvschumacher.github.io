                <h1>RA / PHD Recruitment</h1>
                <h2>RA Recruitment</h2>
                <p>RA recruitment goes through the whole year. Both XJTLU students and non-XJTLU students could apply.
                Please contact Dr. Shengchen Li for further information. </p>
                <p>Usually students applying for a RA position should propose a project. From time to time, there will be 
                    some mini projects calling for RAs. </p>
                <p>RA may be invited to continue their research as a PhD student at XJTLU. Usually grant will be provided
                    according to performance of RA.</p>
                <h3>SURF Project</h3>
                <p>This year there are three SURF projects offered this year. For each SURF proejct, students are suppose
                    to spend 10 weeks onsite to perform basic research. Usually SURF projects only accpet XJTLU students.
                    The abstract of three projects are as follows.</p>
                <p>All projects are subject to approval of XJTLU. If you are interested in applying one of the SURF projects
                    listed here, please fill in <a href="https://www.wjx.cn/vm/epMP17a.aspx">this survey </a>to register
                    your interests. </p>
                <p><b>Expressive Timing Modelling in Performed Classical Piano Music:</b>
                    This project aims to develop an algorithm that can analyse and model the unique expressive timing of
                    a particular pianist, enabling the generation of performances of any piece of music in the style of
                    the candidate pianist. By capturing the subtle nuances and variations in timing and dynamics that
                    define a style of performance, this research will contribute to the field of expressive musical
                    performance modelling. The obtained model would support a better understanding of newly composed
                    music for composers, providing insights into how their compositions might be interpreted and performed
                    by the modelled pianist. The anticipated outcomes include a working algorithm capable of generating
                    stylistically accurate performances and valuable insights into the modelling of expressive timing.
                    This research has the potential to advance our understanding of musical expression and open up new
                    possibilities for computer-generated music that more closely resembles human performances, as well as
                    assisting composers in visualising the potential interpretations of their work.</p>
                <p><b>Detection and Identification of Synthesised Music:</b>
                    In the modern music landscape, the line between synthesised and real music has become increasingly blurred.
                    This project aims to develop an algorithm capable of accurately identifying synthesised music among
                    real musical compositions. By leveraging advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning
                    algorithms, the proposed system will analyse musical samples and determine whether they are synthesised
                    or performed by human musicians. The development of such an algorithm has significant implications
                    for various fields, including music copyright protection, plagiarism detection, and musicological
                    research. The anticipated outcomes include a robust algorithm for synthesised music detection and a
                    deeper understanding of the characteristics that distinguish synthesised music from real musical
                    performances. This research has the potential to contribute to the advancement of music technology
                    and its applications in multiple domains.</p>
                <p><b>Detection and Identification of Cover Song:</b>
                    In the vast landscape of music, cover songs – different renditions of the same musical composition –
                    are a common occurrence. This project aims to develop an algorithm capable of accurately identifying
                    cover songs among a collection of musical recordings. By leveraging advanced audio signal processing
                    techniques and machine learning algorithms, the proposed system will analyze musical features and
                    determine whether two given recordings are renditions of the same piece. The development of such an
                    algorithm has significant implications for various fields, including music copyright protection, music
                    recommendation systems, and musicological research. The anticipated outcomes include a robust algorithm
                    for cover song identification and a deeper understanding of the musical characteristics that define
                    a song's identity across different renditions. This research has the potential to contribute to the
                    advancement of music information retrieval and its applications in multiple domains.</p>
