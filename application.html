                <h1>RA / PHD Recruitment</h1>
                <h2>RA Recruitment</h2>
                <p>RA recruitment goes through the whole year. Both XJTLU students and non-XJTLU students could apply.
                Please contact Dr. Shengchen Li for further information. Please note that for XJTLU students, ALA hours
                does not grant RA compensate according to University policy. </p>
                <p>Usually students applying for a RA position should propose a project. From time to time, there will be 
                    some mini projects calling for RAs.
                </p>
                <h3>SURF Project</h3>
                <p>There is a <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/events/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowships/introduction"> 
                    SURF project </a> calling for 6 participants and 3 volunteers.</p>
                <p>The project is named "Smart Music Generation System" containing six mini-projects:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Lyrics Generation: generate song lyrics according to information such as a starting sentence, motion of lyrics, 
                    etc. </li>
                <li>Music structure determination: based on the lyrics generated, a smart system should be built to determine the 
                    structure of music. The music structure is determined by the arrangement of the lyrics.</li>
                <li>Melody Generation: generate a piece of melody that could fit the lyrics provided. Usually, the pronunciation 
                    of melodies should be converted to rhythm of melody first then the melody will be generated accordingly.</li>
                <li>Music Accompaniment Generation: generate music accompaniment of melodies with a given piece of melody.</li>
                <li>Smart Music Production: based on given information, there should be a system that generate music waveform 
                    according to the information given.</li>
                <li>Music Evaluation: the mini project aims to measure the quality of generated music in an objective way. 
                    Besides, it is also necessary to build a universal user interface for the whole project.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The student would like to apply for this SURF project, please mail me at shengchen.li@xjtlu.edu.cn with the 
                    key word "[SURF]" in title. A CV should be attached (preferably have a photo) in the application.</p>
                <p>The student with the following criteria prioritised:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experienced in Machine Learning Algorithms</li>
                    <li>Would like to pursue a PhD in the field of computer music processing in the future</li>
                    <li>Aim at publishing a paper or further expending the work to a FYP project.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>PhD Recruitment</h2>
                <p>Throughout the year, self-fund PhD application is welcome. From time to time, PhD studentship will be 
                    provided. </p>
                <p>The candidate student will be awarded a PhD degree from the University of Liverpool (UK) upon successful
                    completion of a PhD program.</p>
                <p>The candidate should have a first class or upper second class honours degree, or a masterâ€™s degree
                    (or equivalent qualification), in related fields such as Electronic Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
                <p>Evidence of good spoken and written English is essential. The candidate should have an IELTS score of
                    6.5 or above, if the first language is not English. This position is open to all qualified candidates
                    irrespective of nationality.</p>
                <p>Students (especially self-fund students) are interested in PhD application should contact
                    Dr. Shengchen Li directly. </p>
                <p>Further information could be found at XJTLU official pages of
                    <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/admissions/global/entry-requirements/">entry requirements</a> and

                <h3>PGRS Studentship</h3>
                <p>Currently there is a PGRS studentship open to all students.</p>
                <p><b>Funding:</b>The PhD studentship is available for three years subject to satisfactory progress by
                    the student. The award covers tuition fees for three years (currently equivalent to RMB 80,000 per
                    annum). It also provides up to RMB 16,500 to allow participation at international conferences during
                    the period of the award. The scholarship holder is expected to carry out a major part of his or her
                    research at XJTLU in Suzhou, China. However, he or she is eligible for a research study visit to the
                    University of Liverpool up to six months if this is required by the project. <b>Excellent canadidate
                    may be funded for a maintenance fee of RMB 5,000 per month by the research project runs by Dr.
                    Shengchen Li.</b></p>
                <p><b>Project Description:</b>Acoustic signal processing techniques help machines understand the content
                    of environment sound. Typical acoustic signal processing tasks include audio tagging, acoustic event
                    detection, acoustic scenes classification and automated audio captioning. The performance of acoustic
                    signal processing system is affected by many factors such as the SNR of audio, the devices to collect
                    audio and the location of audio. These factors all bias the acoustic features of audio hence the
                    robustness of acoustic signal processing methods suffer. The proposed research investigates the way
                    to improve algorithm robustness for acoustic signal processing. Given the fact that the features
                    extracted can represent all meta data of acoustic signals, the features related to useless meta data
                    and proposed classifications should disentangled. The process of removing the biased features can be
                    considered as the domain generalisation process, which is pursued as the target of the proposed
                    research.</p>
